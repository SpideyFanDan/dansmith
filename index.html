                    <div><p >
					My name is Dan Smith, I was a masters level language teacher in NYC for 15 years, and for the last year, I've been learning computer languages in order to shift my career focus to media and technology. I've been fortunate enough to work on projects related to things that I am passionate about as is evident in my <a href="/dansmith/portfolio.html">portfolio</a>.</p></div>
			
				<div><p>
					I am an adventurous soul with a child-like nature. I love comic books
					and particularly Spider-Man comics that I have read since I was a kid.
					My first software development app that I ever created using HTML, CSS,
					and JavaScript was a trivia app about the legend himself.

                </div>
				<div><p>
					I love to travel and speak several languages such as Italian,
					French, and Spanish. I have lived in countries where those languages
					are spoken and traveled to many more. While in Graduate School to
					become a teacher I won the original iPhone from a <a href="/dansmith/blog.html">travel blog</a> I wrote
					back in the summer of 2007 and continued to write more to that blog
					because I find it fun and therapeutic.
				</p></div>
				<div><p>
					I also ride my bike as a predominant means of transportation, partly
					to save money on other means of travel, but mostly to reduce my carbon
					footprint. I recently moved to Denver, Colorado in order to enjoy a
					new adventure in life and I can't wait to get a mountain bike so I can
					add new blog posts to my travel experiences as I find new trails to
					ride on in this outdoorsy city and state.
