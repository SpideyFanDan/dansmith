                    <div><p >
					My name is Dan Smith, I was a Master Language Teacher in NYC for 15 years, and transitioned into EdTech and Instructional design during the pandemic. I've been learning computer languages and UX/UI design in order to shift my career focus to media and technology. Visit my <a href="/dansmith/portfolio.html">portfolio</a> for samples of my work.</p></div>
			
				<div><p>
					I am an adventurous soul with a child-like nature. I love comic books
					and particularly Spider-Man comics that I have read since I was a kid.
					My first software development app that I ever created using HTML, CSS,
					and JavaScript was a trivia app about the Superhero himself.

				<div><p>
					I love to travel and speak several languages such as Italian,
					French, and Spanish. I have lived in countries where those languages
					are spoken and traveled to many more beyond. While in Graduate School to
					become a teacher I won the original iPhone from a <a href="/dansmith/blog.html">travel blog</a> I wrote
					back in the summer of 2007 and continued to write more to that blog
					because I find it fun and therapeutic.
				</p></div>
				<div><p>
					I also ride my bike as a predominant means of transportation, partly
					to save money on other means of travel, but mostly to reduce my carbon
					footprint. I enjoy outdoor adventures but I'm also happy to relax at home playing board games, video games, or cooking and enjoying the company of friends.
